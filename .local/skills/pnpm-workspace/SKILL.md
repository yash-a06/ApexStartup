└── package.json            # Root task orchestration and shared dev tooling
```

## TypeScript

Default model:

- `lib/*` packages are composite and emit declarations via `tsc --build`.
- `artifacts/*` and `scripts` are leaf workspace packages checked with `tsc --noEmit`. They should never import from each other, if you need to share functionality (encouraged) you must create a new lib.
- Root `tsconfig.json` is a solution file for libs only, used by `tsc --build`.
- `tsconfig.base.json` contains shared strict defaults. Not all packages extend it (e.g. Expo apps will use its own base).

Root commands:

- `pnpm run typecheck:libs` runs `tsc --build` for the composite libs.
- `pnpm run typecheck` is the canonical full check: builds libs first, then runs leaf workspace package typechecks.
- Prefer the root `typecheck` result over editor/LSP state when they disagree.

Adding a new lib:

- Add `composite`, `declarationMap`, and `emitDeclarationOnly` to its `tsconfig.json`.
- Add it to the root `tsconfig.json` `references` array.
- If it imports another lib, add that lib to its own `references`.

Adding a new artifact:

- Should be usually handled via the `artifacts` skill unless no artifact template satisfies the user's requirements.
- Do **not** add it to the root `tsconfig.json` references.

Project references:

- When one lib imports another lib, the importing lib must declare it in `references` so `tsc --build` can order and rebuild correctly.
- Root `tsconfig.json` should list the lib packages, not every workspace package.
- Artifact `references` to libs are optional but useful for:
  - explicit documentation of direct workspace dependencies
  - better editor/tsserver project awareness
  - standalone `tsc -b artifacts/<name>` style workflows

## Server & API contracts

For backend-backed apps, define the contract in OpenAPI first, then generate helpers from it.

Codegen command:

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen`

This generates files such as React Query hooks and Zod schemas. No follow-up `typecheck:libs` is needed. It is strongly recommended that you use them. The server should use Zod schemas to validate inputs and outputs, and clients should use the available hooks.

## Logging

**Never use `console.log` in server code.** Use `req.log` in route handlers and the singleton `logger` for non-request code. See `.local/skills/pnpm-workspace/references/server.md` for setup and examples.

## `scripts` (`@workspace/scripts`)

Put shared utility scripts in `./scripts`.

- Each script lives in `scripts/src/`
- Add a matching npm script in `scripts/package.json`
- `scripts` is treated like a leaf workspace package and typechecked with `tsc --noEmit`

## Proxy & service routing

A global reverse proxy routes traffic by path using each artifact's `.replit-artifact/artifact.toml`.

Example:

```toml
[[services]]
localPort = 8080
name = "API Server"
paths = ["/api"]
```

**Rules for accessing services:**

- For ad hoc requests, such as `curl`, always go through the shared proxy at `localhost:80`. Never call service ports directly.
  - Correct: `localhost:80/api/healthz`
  - Wrong: `localhost:8080/api/healthz`
- Paths are not rewritten. Services must handle their full base path themselves.
- The only exception is the EXPO artifact. If one exists, use $REPLIT_EXPO_DEV_DOMAIN to access it locally.
- In application code, prefer relative URLs when possible. For user-facing access, both development previews and published production domains already route through the shared proxy automatically. Published apps are exposed over HTTPS on the domains listed in `$REPLIT_DOMAINS` (comma-separated).
- Do NOT add Vite proxy configs or custom base URLs to reach other services; the shared proxy already handles cross-service routing.
- Routes across artifacts are matched most-specific-first, so a service on `/api` won't conflict with one on `/`.

## Package management

Workspace package rules:

- Workspace package names should use the `@workspace/` prefix.
- Each package must declare its own dependencies; dependencies are not shared implicitly across workspace packages.
- Root dependencies are for repo-level tooling such as `typescript`, `prettier`, `eslint`, `vitest`, etc.
- Do not use `pnpm add --no-frozen-lockfile`. `pnpm add` will automatically use `catalog:` if the dependency already has a catalog entry.

### devDependencies vs dependencies

- **Static/client-only artifacts** (Vite-built React apps): all packages → `devDependencies`.
- **Server artifacts**: runtime imports (`express`, `drizzle-orm`, `pg`) → `dependencies`; build tools, `@types/*` → `devDependencies`.
- If a dependency already exists in the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` catalog, use `"catalog:"`.
- Libraries should declare shared runtimes (`react`, `react-dom`) as `peerDependencies`.

## Codegen Outputs

See `.local/skills/pnpm-workspace/references/openapi.md` for generated file paths and naming conventions. Do not change the OpenAPI `info.title` — it controls generated filenames.

## Common pitfalls

- **Do not run `pnpm dev` or `pnpm run dev` at the workspace root.** Replit apps run via workflows, not root-level pnpm dev. The root has no `dev` script by design, and individual artifacts need env vars (`PORT`, `BASE_PATH`) that the workflow config wires up. To run or verify an app, use `restart_workflow <slug>` or view the preview pane — do not shell out to `pnpm dev`.
- **Verify artifacts with `pnpm --filter @workspace/<slug> run typecheck`, not `build`.** `build` needs workflow-provided `PORT` and `BASE_PATH`, so it can fail from bash even when typecheck passes.
- Do not introduce an all-composite setup for leaf workspace packages. Declaration emit from apps causes type portability issues (TS2742) when multiple versions of `@types/*` packages exist across workspace packages.
- Do not add leaf workspace packages to the root `tsconfig.json` references; that solution file is for buildable libs only.
- Prefer root commands with `--filter` when targeting a specific package:
  - `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run build`
- If the editor and CLI disagree on cross-package types, trust `pnpm run typecheck`.
- If you change Orval output paths or the barrel exports, generated imports may break.

## Artifact Lifecycle

If you are creating or updating an artifact, follow the `artifacts` skill for the artifact callback lifecycle (`createArtifact`, `verifyAndReplaceArtifactToml`, `presentArtifact`, and `suggestDeploy()`) instead of redefining it here.
